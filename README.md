# SeqRec Benchmark Datasets

## Introduction

Our **SeqRec Benchmark** provides a series of standardized datasets for sequential recommendation. These datasets are crawled from various sources, including Amazon, Douban, Gowalla, MovieLens, Yelp, etc. For those review datasets where text metadata is available, we also process the item title data for LLM-based recommendation.

### Dataset Format

The processed datasets contain the following files:

- `user2item.pkl`: A Pandas DataFrame with three columns: `UserID`, `ItemID` and `Timestamp`. Each row represents a user and the items they have interacted with, along with the corresponding timestamps. The `UserID` column contains the unique and sorted user IDs. The `ItemID` and `Timestamp` columns are lists of item IDs and timestamps, respectively. Note that the `UserID` and `ItemID` are both starting from 100, while the 0-99 IDs are reserved for the special tokens (e.g. `<PAD>`), and the `Timestamp` is in Unix time format.
- `item2title.pkl`: A Pandas DataFrame with two columns: `ItemID` and `Title`. Each row represents an item and its corresponding title. The `ItemID` column contains the unique and sorted item IDs, and the `Title` column contains the item titles. Note that `item2title.pkl` is only available for those datasets with text metadata.
- `summary.json`: A JSON file that contains the dataset statistics.

Let's take `amazon2014-book` dataset as an example:

- `amazon2014-book/proc/user2item.pkl`:

### Dataset Processing Methods

The dataset processing methods are provided in the [process_data/base_dataset.py](https://github.com/Tiny-Snow/SeqRecBenchmark-Datasets/tree/main/process_data/base_dataset.py). Basically, we will process the dataset into the following steps:

- **Load the raw data**: implemented in the `DatasetProcessor._load_data()` method. In this step, two Pandas DataFrames are returned: `interactions` with each row as an interaction and three columns: `(UserID, ItemID, Timestamp)`, and `item2title` with each row as an item and two columns: `(ItemID, Title)`. This virtual method should be overridden in the specific DatasetProcessor subclass. Just load the data from the raw files, and no need to do any processing here.
- **Filter the invalid item titles**: optionally implemented in the `DatasetProcessor._filter_item_title()` method. By default, we only filter the items with empty titles. You may override this method in the specific DatasetProcessor subclass to specify the filtering rules.
- **Drop duplicate users/items**: implemented in the `DatasetProcessor._drop_duplicates()` method. This step is to drop the users or items with duplicate IDs.
- **Sample users**: implemented in the `DatasetProcessor._sample_users()` method. If the dataset is too large (especially for the LLM-based recommendation), we may sample the users to reduce the dataset size. Note that the final dataset usually has smaller user size than the number specified in this step, since some users may be filtered out in the later steps (e.g., $K$-core filtering).
- **Apply $K$-core filtering**: implemented in the `DatasetProcessor._filter_k_core()` method. This step is to filter the users and items with less than $K$ interactions. The default value of $K$ is 5.
- **Group the interactions**: implemented in the `DatasetProcessor._group_interactions()` method. In this step, the interactions with the same user are grouped together, and the items are sorted by the timestamp (from the earliest to the latest).
- **Apply consecutive numeric ID mapping**: implemented in the `DatasetProcessor._apply_id_mapping()` method. In this step, we will apply the consecutive numeric ID mapping for the users and items, and the final IDs start from 100. The final DataFrames `user2item` and `item2title` are sorted by `UserID` and `ItemID`, respectively.
- **Save the processed data and statistics**: implemented in the `DatasetProcessor._save_processed_data()` method. In this step, we will save the processed data into the `dataset_name[_sample_user_size]/proc` directory. The processed data includes `user2item.pkl`, `item2title.pkl` and `summary.json`. If the dataset is sampled to `sample_user_size` users, the `_sample_user_size` suffix will be added to the dataset name.

**Reducing Dataset Size.** For those extremely large datasets, we randomly sample some users to reduce the dataset size. For instance, the `Amazon-2018-Book` dataset has over 27M interactions, we provide the 1M users sampled version `Amazon-2018-Book-1M`. Even though the original dataset is listed here, we may not provide its processed version due to the limited storage space.

**Customization.** You can modify and run [run_process_data.sh](https://github.com/Tiny-Snow/SeqRecBenchmark-Datasets/tree/main/run_process_data.sh) to customize your dataset processing.

**Dependencies.** The processed datasets are generated by Python 3.12.10 with `pickle protocol 5`. Note that Python 3.8+ is required to read the processed `.pkl` files.

### Amazon

#### Description

The Amazon dataset is a large crawl of product reviews from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), including reviews, metadata and graphs. We process two versions of the Amazon dataset: [Amazon-2014](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon/links.html) and [Amazon-2018](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/). The latest [Amazon-2023](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/) dataset can be similarly processed, though the researchers rarely adopt it in the papers. Due to the large size and high sparsity of the Amazon dataset, it is usually divided into specific domains, including `Amazon-Beauty`, `Amazon-Book` (Books), `Amazon-CD` (CDs and Vinyl), `Amazon-Clothing` (Clothing, Shoes and Jewelry), `Amazon-Electronic` (Electronics), `Amazon-Health` (Health and Personal Care), `Amazon-Movie` (Movies and TV), `Amazon-Toy` (Toys and Games), `Amazon-Game` (Video Games), etc. The item titles are accessible in all Amazon datasets except for `Amazon-2014-Game` (thus we do not provide this dataset). For those extremely large datasets (> 5M interactions, e.g., `Amazon-2018-Book`), we sample 1M users from the original dataset to reduce the dataset size (e.g., `Amazon-2018-Book-1M`). For more processing details, please refer to the [process_data/amazon_dataset.py](https://github.com/Tiny-Snow/SeqRecBenchmark-Datasets/tree/main/process_data/amazon_dataset.py).

### Food

#### Description

The [Food](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions) dataset consists of recipes and reviews from [Food.com](https://www.food.com/). The review text and various recipe metadata are also provided. We take the name of recipe as the item title.

### Gowalla

#### Description

The [Gowalla](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html) dataset is a check-in dataset collected from the location-based social network [Gowalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gowalla), which is widely used in collaborative filtering and sequential recommendation research. Note that the item metadata is not available in the original dataset, and we only provide the user-item interaction data `user2item.pkl`. The processed dataset has over 4.6M interactions, which is somewhat large for research purposes. Thus we also provide a smaller version `Gowalla-50K` with 1.8M interactions, which samples 50K users from the original dataset. For more processing details, please refer to the [process_data/gowalla_dataset.py](https://github.com/Tiny-Snow/SeqRecBenchmark-Datasets/tree/main/process_data/gowalla_dataset.py).

### KuaiRec

#### Description

The [KuaiRec](https://kuairec.com/) dataset (version 2.0) is a real-world dataset collected from the recommendation logs of the video-sharing mobile app [Kuaishou](https://www.kuaishou.com/cn). The dataset contains two types of interaction data: `big_matrix` and `small_matrix`, where the `small_matrix` is a fully-observed dataset, and the `big_matrix` is a sparser peripheral dataset that excludes the user-video interactions in the `small_matrix`. To construct a proper sequential recommendation dataset based on KuaiRec, as suggested in the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.10842), we merge the `big_matrix` and `small_matrix` datasets, and then filter the "negative" interactions where the user's cumulative watching time is less than twice the video duration. We do not provide the item titles in the processed dataset, as the video titles here are not appropriate for LLM-based recommendation -- they are full of emoticons and keyword tags. For more processing details, please refer to the [process_data/kuairec_dataset.py](https://github.com/Tiny-Snow/SeqRecBenchmark-Datasets/tree/main/process_data/kuairec_dataset.py).

### MovieLens

#### Description

The MovieLens (ML) dataset is crawled from the [MovieLens](https://movielens.org) website, consisting of the ratings and metadata of user-movie interactions. The MovieLens dataset is widely used in recommender systems research due to its dense and rich interaction data. The dataset is available in several versions, including [MovieLens-1M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/), [MovieLens-10M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/), [MovieLens-20M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/), [MovieLens-25M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/), and the latest [MovieLens-32M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/32m/) datasets. We process all these versions, and note that the MovieLens-1M and MovieLens-20M (usually sampled) are the most frequently used datasets in the research papers. For more processing details, please refer to the [process_data/movielens_dataset.py](https://github.com/Tiny-Snow/SeqRecBenchmark-Datasets/tree/main/process_data/movielens_dataset.py).

### RetailRocket

#### Description

The [RetailRocket](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset) dataset is a real-world dataset collected from the [RetailRocket](https://retailrocket.net/) e-commerce platform. The dataset contains three types of user-item interactions: `view`, `addtocart`, and `transaction`. Following the [previous work](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3539618.3591624), we only keep the `view` interactions for sequential recommendation. Note that the item titles are not available in the original dataset, and we only provide the user-item interaction data `user2item.pkl`. For more processing details, please refer to the [process_data/retailrocket_dataset.py](https://github.com/Tiny-Snow/SeqRecBenchmark-Datasets/tree/main/process_data/retailrocket_dataset.py).

### Steam

#### Description

The [Steam](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#steam_data) dataset (version 2) contains the video game reviews and game metadata crawled from the [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) platform. This dataset is widely used in sequential recommendation research. To facilitate the research, we also provide two smaller versions: `Steam-1M` and `Steam-100K`, which sample 1M and 100K users from the original dataset, respectively. The item titles are accessible in both datasets. For more processing details, please refer to the [process_data/steam_dataset.py](https://github.com/Tiny-Snow/SeqRecBenchmark-Datasets/tree/main/process_data/steam_dataset.py).

### YooChoose

#### Description

The [YooChoose](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chadgostopp/recsys-challenge-2015) dataset is originally provided by [YooChoose](http://www.yoochoose.com/) for the [RecSys Challenge 2015](https://recsys.acm.org/recsys15/challenge/). The dataset contains a collection of sessions from a retailer, where each session is encapsulating the click events that the user performed in the session. The data was collected during several months in the year of 2014, reflecting the clicks and purchases performed by the users of an on-line retailer in Europe. The dataset is divided into two parts: `YooChoose-Clicks` and `YooChoose-Buys`, containing the click and purchase events, respectively. Both the two datasets are provided with labels `Session ID` (i.e., `UserID`), `Item ID` (i.e., `ItemID`) and `Timestamp`. However, the item metadata is not available in the original dataset, and we only provide the user-item interaction data `user2item.pkl`. Additionally, as the `YooChoose-Clicks` dataset is extremely large (16M interactions), we randomly sample 100K/500K users to reduce the dataset size, resulting in `YooChoose-Clicks-100K` and `YooChoose-Clicks-500K`. Note that we drop the test data `yoochoose-test.dat` to make the training paradigm of the two datasets consistent. For more processing details, please refer to the [process_data/yoochoose_dataset.py](https://github.com/Tiny-Snow/SeqRecBenchmark-Datasets/tree/main/process_data/yoochoose_dataset.py).

### Yelp

#### Description

The [Yelp](https://business.yelp.com/data/resources/open-dataset) dataset is a subset of [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/)'s businesses, reviews, and user data. It was originally put together for the Yelp Dataset Challenge, which is a chance for students to conduct research or analysis on Yelp's data and share their discoveries. The complete Yelp dataset contains five files: `business.json`, `checkin.json`, `review.json`, `tip.json`, and `user.json`. For sequential recommendation, we process `review.json` to get the user-business interactions, and the `business.json` file to get the business metadata. This results in the processed [Yelp2018](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset/versions/1) and [Yelp2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset/versions/4) datasets. In addition, we also provide the smaller versions `Yelp2018-500K` and `Yelp2022-500K` for research purposes, which sample 500K users from the original datasets. The lastest version of the Yelp dataset is available in [Yelp Open Dataset](https://business.yelp.com/data/resources/open-dataset). For historical versions, please refer to [Kaggle Yelp](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset). For more processing details, please refer to the [process_data/yelp_dataset.py](https://github.com/Tiny-Snow/SeqRecBenchmark-Datasets/tree/main/process_data/yelp_dataset.py).
